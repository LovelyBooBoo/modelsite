		I've always loved all things techincal and have been <br />
		learning JS, HTML, and the three.js library for a few <br />
		months. I'm also a motion designer and animator so <br />
		embedding my projects in a context I already understand <br />
		has been really helpful. <br />
		<br />
		I've learned so much in the past few months and loved <br />
		every moment of it. I'd be incredibly excited to talk to <br />
		you about what I've learned, and the game I made at <br />
		interview.
