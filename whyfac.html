		I'm really attracted to the collaborative approach at FAC. <br />
        I also learn best through making things and doing my own <br />
        research, so the hands-on project-based curriculum would <br />
        suit me perfectly.<br />
        <br />
        The prospect of working with other students to create amazing <br />
        portfolio pieces is really exciting for me and I know that the <br />
        broad set of skills I have in 3D animation and design wiil be <br />
        a unique asset for the team when we're developing something unique <br />

        When I visited for one of your workshops it was a pleasure to <br />
        meet some of the team. I'd really love the opportunity to do it <br />
        again!<br />
